    <h1>College Education and Work Experience</h1>

      <p>
        My work experience mainly consists of customer service and hospitality.
        Although I’ve always wanted to teach, I was too busy throughout college
        to tutor or substitute so I took up various serving jobs at different
        restaurants. Currently, I am working at a fine dining wine and
        steakhouse while also doing freelance Spanish interpreting. Before this,
        I worked as a teller at a bank, and also as a dispatcher for the
        Washington Dulles Airport. When it comes to my college education, I took
        the general required credits for my first two years, and when I became
        an English major, I chose Literature as my concentration. I took various
        African American and Literature classes, Latino Literature Classes,
        Creative Writing, Literary Theory, and varying Literature classes from
        different time period. When I got into graduate school, I also pursued
        English Literature but I got to take different classes such as poetry,
        Native American Literature, and British Literature.
