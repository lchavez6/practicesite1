        I thought I would be working on a thesis in order to graduate but
        instead I took two optional electives. However, I found I was most
        interested in 18th century American literature. If I had pursued a
        thesis, I would have written it about Kate Chopin’s <i>The Awakening</i>
        and the ways that femininity is limited within the society that the novel
        takes place. I have also included term papers for the classes I found most interesting.
        Such as early American Literature, Literary Criticism, and even Shakespeare. I
        found that I geared mostly towards race relations and the complications
        of sexuality and gender.
